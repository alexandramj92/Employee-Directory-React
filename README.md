# Employee Directory

## Description

This allows the user to see a directory of all the employees at a company. They can search by department name and sort by last name. 

## Usage

When the page initializes, the user sees all employees. When they type in the name of a department, this filters the employees and only displays those that correspond with that department.

When the user clicks on the sort button next to the last name table header, it sorts the table by last name in ascending order. When the user clicks on the button again, it sorts it by descending order. The user can change the order between ascending and descending as many times as they wish.
